Add specstory to ignore files

I'll help you add `.specstory` to the ignore files. First, let me check if there's a `.gitignore` file in the repository.

Great, I found the `.gitignore` file. Let me check its current contents before making changes.

Read file: .gitignore

Now I'll add `.specstory` to the `.gitignore` file. I'll add it in a new section specifically for SpecStory:

---

```diff
  ENV/ 
  .aider*
+ 
+ # SpecStory
+ .specstory/
  
```

I've added `.specstory/` to your `.gitignore` file in a new section. The changes have been applied successfully. Now Git will ignore the `.specstory` directory and its contents. Is there anything else you need help with?
