_**Assistant**_

I'll help you implement rich and pretty colors in your project. Let me first explore the codebase to understand its structure and where we can add color enhancements.

Let me examine the main Python file to understand the application and where we can add rich colors.

Let me check if there are any dependencies in the project that might help with adding rich colors.

Now I'll look at how the CLI commands are currently displaying output to understand where we can add rich colors.

Based on my examination of the code, I can see that the project is using Typer for CLI commands but doesn't currently use the Rich library for colorful output. Let me implement rich and pretty colors to enhance the visual experience of the CLI.

First, I'll add the Rich library to the project dependencies and then modify the code to use Rich for colorful output.

```diff
      "beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0",
      "requests>=2.31.0",
+     "rich>=13.7.0",
  ]
  
```

Now, let's modify the main Python file to use Rich for colorful output. I'll update the imports and enhance the display of tasks with colors.

```diff
  import uuid
  import time
+ from rich.console import Console
+ from rich.theme import Theme
+ from rich.panel import Panel
+ from rich.table import Table
+ from rich.text import Text
+ from rich import box
+ 
+ # Create a custom theme for consistent colors
+ custom_theme = Theme({
+     "info": "cyan",
+     "warning": "yellow",
+     "danger": "bold red",
+     "success": "green",
+     "project": "blue",
+     "tag": "magenta",
+     "date": "yellow",
+     "flag": "bold red",
+     "header": "bold cyan",
+     "task": "white",
+ })
+ 
+ # Create a console with our custom theme
+ console = Console(theme=custom_theme)
  
  app = typer.Typer(
```

Now let's update the list_grouped_tasks function to use Rich for colorful output:
